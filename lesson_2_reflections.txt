What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Adds a .git file to the dir. So we can use git for the dir.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area tracks changes in files, while the working directory does not.
The repository shows files in the staging area, and working dir.
Lets us track changes made before committing changes to git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
By running git diff and seeing what changes where made from the working directory


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help us understand the flow of the branches

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging combines two branches into the same branch. To show we can flow back
to commits from both of the previous branches



What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Pro: Saves Time
Con: User will know exactly what is being merged
